This Python script is a simple calculator program. It starts by importing an 'art' module, which is presumably used to display some form of ASCII art logo for the calculator.

The script defines four functions: add, subtract, multiply, and divide, each performing the respective arithmetic operation. The divide function includes a check for division by zero, which is not allowed. If a user tries to divide by zero, they are prompted to restart the calculator.

The operations are stored in a dictionary called operations, where the keys are the symbols for the operations and the values are the corresponding functions.

The calculator function is the main function of the program. It first prints the logo, then prompts the user for two numbers and an operation. It retrieves the appropriate function from the operations dictionary and applies it to the numbers, then prints the result.

The calculator then enters a loop where it asks the user if they want to continue calculating with the previous result or start a new calculation. If they choose to continue, they are prompted for another operation and number, and the result is calculated and printed. If they choose to start a new calculation, the calculator function is called recursively.

The script ends by calling the calculator function to start the program.
