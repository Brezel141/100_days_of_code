This Python script is a simple implementation of a secret auction system.

At the start, it imports a clear function from replit module to clear the console and 
art module to display some art (presumably the logo of the auction).

The find_winner function takes a dictionary of bids (where the keys are bidder names 
and the values are their respective bids) and iterates over them to find the highest bid. 
The bidder with the highest bid is declared as the winner.

The main loop of the program asks for the user's name and bid amount, and adds them to 
the bider dictionary. It then asks if there is another bidder. If the user inputs 'no', 
the loop ends and the winner is found using the find_winner function. If the user inputs 
'yes', the console is cleared and the loop continues to accept more bids.
