This code is a simple band name generator. It prompts the user to input the name of the city they grew up in and 
the name of their first pet. Then, it combines these inputs to generate a unique band name. Finally, it prints 
out the newly generated band name for the user to see. It's a fun way to create a band name based on personal experiences.
