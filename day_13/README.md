This Python script is a collection of small code snippets, each demonstrating a different common type of bug or error in programming. The script is designed to help users practice debugging.

The first snippet has a logical error. The loop iterates from 1 to 19, but the condition checks if i is 20, which it never is.

The second snippet has an off-by-one error. The randint function generates a number from 1 to 6, but this is used as an index to access elements in dice_imgs, which has indices from 0 to 5.

The third snippet has a boundary error. The conditions check if year is greater than 1980 and less than 1994, but they should check if year is greater than or equal to 1980 and less than or equal to 1994.

The fourth snippet has a syntax error. The print statement is not indented correctly. Also, age is read as a string but compared as an integer.

The fifth snippet has a typo. The == operator is used instead of the = operator to assign a value to word_per_page.

The last snippet has a logical error. The append statement is not indented correctly, so it is not part of the loop. As a result, only the last item in a_list is multiplied by 2 and added to b_list.
