This Python script is a game where the player has to guess which of two options has more followers on social media. The game data is imported from a separate module, and the game is played in the console.

The get_random_account function selects a random account from the game data.

The format_data function takes an account and returns a string that describes the account.

The check_answer function takes the player's guess and the follower counts of the two options, and returns whether the player's guess was correct.

The game function is the main game loop. It first prints the game logo and initializes the score and game state. It then enters a loop where it selects two random accounts, makes sure they are not the same, and prompts the player to guess which has more followers. If the player's guess is correct, their score is increased and the game continues with the next round. If the player's guess is incorrect, the game ends and their final score is printed.
