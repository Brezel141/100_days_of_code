This Python script is designed to solve a maze in the Reeborg's World platform, a tool used to teach programming.

The script defines a function turn_right() which is implemented by calling turn_left() three times, as Reeborg's 
World does not natively support a turn_right() function.

The script then moves Reeborg forward as long as the path is clear. When Reeborg encounters a wall, it turns left.

The main loop of the script continues until Reeborg reaches the goal. In each iteration of the loop, the script 
checks if the right side is clear. If so, Reeborg turns right and moves forward. If the right side is not clear 
but the front is, Reeborg moves forward. If neither the right side nor the front is clear, Reeborg turns left. 
This algorithm effectively makes Reeborg follow the right wall of the maze until it reaches the goal.
