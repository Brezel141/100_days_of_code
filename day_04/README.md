This Python script is a text-based version of the game Rock, Paper, Scissors.

The game starts by defining three variables, rock, paper, and scissors, each containing a 
string representation of the corresponding hand shape. These are stored in a list rps.

The script then generates a random integer between 0 and 2, representing the computer's choice 
(rock, paper, or scissors respectively). The user is then prompted to make a choice in the same range.

Both the user's and computer's choices are printed out, represented by the corresponding string from the rps list.

The game then determines the winner by comparing the user's choice and the computer's choice. 
If the choices are the same, it's a draw. If the user chooses rock and the computer chooses 
paper, the user loses, and so on, following the standard rules of Rock, Paper, Scissors. 
The result of the game is then printed out.
