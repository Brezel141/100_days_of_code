This Python script is an implementation of the Caesar Cipher, a type of substitution cipher 
where each letter in the plaintext is shifted a certain number of places down the alphabet.

The script defines a function caeser that takes a text, a shift amount, and a direction 
('encode' or 'decode') as parameters. The function iterates over each character in the text. 
If the character is in the alphabet, it finds the character's index in the alphabet and calculates 
a new index by adding or subtracting the shift amount (depending on the direction). The character 
at the new index in the alphabet replaces the original character in the output text. If the character 
is not in the alphabet (e.g., it's a space or punctuation), it's added to the output text as is.

The script then enters a loop where it prompts the user to choose a direction, enter a message, 
and specify a shift amount. It calls the caeser function with these inputs. After displaying the 
encoded or decoded message, it asks the user if they want to continue. If the user chooses not to 
continue, it exits the loop and prints a goodbye message.
