This Python script is a simple text-based adventure game called "Treasure Island".

The game starts by printing an ASCII art representation of a treasure map and welcoming 
the player to the game. The player's mission, to find the treasure, is also stated.
The player is then presented with a series of choices, represented by input() functions. 
The player's responses to these choices determine the outcome of the game.
The first choice is whether to go left or right. If the player chooses to go left, 
they are presented with another choice: to swim or wait. If they choose to wait, they 
are presented with a final choice: to choose the red, yellow, or blue door. Choosing 
the yellow door leads to victory, while all other choices lead to a game over message.
If at any point the player chooses an option not presented to them, they receive an 
"Invalid input. Game Over!" message.
