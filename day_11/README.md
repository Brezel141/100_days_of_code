This Python script is a simple text-based Blackjack game. It starts by importing the random, art, and replit modules. The art module is used to display an ASCII art logo for the game, and the replit module is used to clear the console.

The deal_card function returns a random card from the deck. The deck is represented as a list of integers, where 11 represents an Ace and 10 represents a 10, Jack, Queen, or King.

The calculate_score function calculates the score of a hand of cards. If the hand is a Blackjack (an Ace and a 10-value card), it returns 0. If the hand contains an Ace and its total value is over 21, it treats the Ace as 1 instead of 11.

The compare function compares the user's score and the computer's score and returns a string describing the result of the game.

The play_blackjack function is the main game loop. It first prints the logo, then deals two cards each to the user and the computer. It then enters a loop where it calculates the scores, displays the user's cards and score and the computer's first card, and asks the user if they want to draw another card or pass. If the user's score is 0 (Blackjack), the computer's score is 0, or the user's score is over 21, the game ends. Otherwise, if the user chooses to draw, they are dealt another card. If they pass, the game ends.

After the user's turn, if the computer's score is less than 17, it continues to draw cards until its score is 17 or higher.

Finally, it displays the user's and computer's final hands and scores, and the result of the game.

The script ends with a loop that asks the user if they want to play again. If they do, it clears the console and starts a new game.
