This code is a simple bill splitter and tip calculator. It prompts the user to input the total bill amount, 
the percentage of tip they would like to give (either 10%, 12%, or 15%), and the number of people splitting 
the bill. It then calculates the total tip amount, adds it to the bill, divides the total by the number of 
people, and rounds the result to two decimal places. Finally, it prints out the amount each person should pay. 
It's a handy tool for evenly splitting bills among friends or groups.
